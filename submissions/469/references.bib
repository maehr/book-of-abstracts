	abstract = {Global philanthropy is a significant source of financial resources in contemporary international relations, and it has provoked intense debates about the appropriateness of involving private foundations in global policymaking. Despite these facts, International Relations as a discipline has shown remarkably little reference to philanthropy as an important and relevant actor in global politics. In this article, I make the case for explicitly incorporating philanthropy into international relations analyses. Drawing on both historical examples and contemporary cases from the global health space, I show how philanthropy exerts a unique and independent influence within international society and that it needs to be understood holistically rather than focusing solely on individual philanthropic organisations. I also discuss how this expanding influence raises serious questions about accountability and legitimacy. Rather than making an argument about the appropriateness of philanthropy’s involvement in international society, this article aims to make the case for philanthropy’s analytical inclusion within the discipline.},

This special volume seeks to explore these state-society dynamics, in terms of the environment for philanthropy and the behaviors of philanthropic actors within this environment. The purpose of our article is multifold. The ﬁrst is to provide the intellectual and empirical contexts in which our collective research is situated. We do so by providing analyzing the state of the existing research and the broad contours of philanthropic activity in China. The second is to situate our initiative within the development of China’s own complex philanthropic studies and philanthropic community. The third is to introduce the scholarship that composes this special volume and its collective contribution. We then provide original data and analysis about corporate philanthropic activity and foundations in China that complements the work of our collaborators. Finally, we consider the implications of the special volume for our broader understanding of philanthropy and suggest potential avenues of a future research agenda.},

	abstract = {The substantive focus is upon the relation between Rockefeller philanthropy and the development of the social sciences during the period, 1910 to 1940. Two major propositions are examined. First, that philanthropic foundations attempt to maintain the social order rather than alter it. Specifically, that during the period under study philanthropic foundations were key institutions in both the reproduction and production of cultural hegemony. Second, that a “criticalconflict” perspective has most value when one is attempting to understand the nature and sources of change in the systematic production of both knowledge and intellectuals. Attention is focussed upon the process by which Rockefeller policy for the social sciences emerged. The policy is described and analysed. The ideological viewpoint of Rockefeller philanthropy as identified in the policy-making process is located in the wider political economy. Confirmation is provided for the two propositions. Hegemony, ideology and social class are essential concepts when one is attempting to understand and explain the role of philanthropy in capitalist societies.},

	abstract = {Philanthropy—private giving for public purposes by individuals, corporations, and foundations—is a widespread activity. Scholarship on philanthropy is long-standing and can be traced to competing theorizations of gift-giving, wherein the gift has been framed as a case of altruism, selfinterest, or reciprocity. Much of the resulting scholarship, in the disciplines of anthropology, economics, evolutionary biology, and psychology, has retained a focus on emphasizing actors’ motivations for the scope and scale of philanthropy. Although sociologists have entered into the study of philanthropy more recently, they nonetheless have made important contributions to its understanding by drawing attention to the social bases of philanthropy. Sociologists have done so through the study of the micro-, meso-, and macrolevel factors that explain variation in philanthropy; the speciﬁcation of the institutional and legal arrangements that permit philanthropy; and the delineation of the social contexts that shape the direction and consequences of philanthropy.},

These campaigns are examined in the context of the imperialist domination of Latin America over the course of this century. The close relationship between prevailing economic, political, and military priorities and the thrust of the Foundation's work in the field of malaria is detailed. In spite of its relatively small financial investment in malaria research and eradication, the Rockefeller Foundation was able to reap enormous benefits from its work in this area. Not only was the Foundation able to increase the profit margins of the Rockefeller empire by ameliorating some of the dire economic consequences of malaria, but also it was able to use its participation to penetrate the public health field and consolidate the hegemony of scientific medicine. It is concluded that the Rockefeller Foundation's attention to the malaria problem reflected more than mere philanthropic concern.},

These questions are certainly as old as social science itself. In this review, we evaluate how today’s scholarship approaches the relationship between markets and the moral order. We begin with Hirschman’s characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice.},

	abstract = {Elite philanthropy—voluntary giving at scale by wealthy individuals, couples and families—is intimately bound up with the exercise of power by elites. This theoretically oriented review examines how big philanthropy in the United States and United Kingdom serves to extend elite control from the domain of the economic to the domains of the social and political, and with what results. Elite philanthropy, we argue, is not simply a benign force for good, born of altruism, but is heavily implicated in what we call the new age of inequalities, certainly as consequence and potentially as cause. Philanthropy at scale pays dividends to donors as much as it brings sustenance to beneficiaries. The research contribution we make is fourfold. First, we demonstrate that the true nature and effects of elite philanthropy can only be understood in the context of what Bourdieu calls the field of power, which maintains the economic, social and political hegemony of the super-rich, nationally and globally. Second, we demonstrate how elite philanthropy systemically concentrates power in the hands of mega foundations and the most prestigious endowed charitable organizations. Third, we explicate the similarities and differences between the four main types of elite philanthropy—institutionally supportive, market-oriented, developmental and transformational—revealing how and why different sections within the elite express themselves through philanthropy. Fourth, we show how elite philanthropy functions to lock in and perpetuate inequalities rather than remedying them. We conclude by outlining proposals for future research, recognizing that under-specification of constructs has hitherto limited the integration of philanthropy within the mainstream of management and organizational research.},

There is a plethora of literature on the capitalist strategies of the diﬀusion of new agricultural technologies, but little emphasis is placed on the motives and modus operandi of philanthropic organizations and their relationship with the state and corporate forces in promoting new seeds and agro-chemicals. This article critically examines the continuity of hegemonic and dispossessive strategies of philanthropic organizations (such as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) in establishing the philanthropic-corporate-state complex to control and exploit primary agricultural producers and their genetic wealth across the globe.},

Philanthropic support for economic development provides flexible, timely resources for innovation, capacity building, and policy advocacy. While philanthropy is often associated with social equity approaches, philanthropic investments in economic development are quite diverse—downtown development, place-based renewal, social enterprises, and economic development networks. This study reviews existing data about philanthropy and economic development, vignettes of foundation investments, and nonprofit perspectives about new foundation roles. Overall, place-rooted foundations are most engaged in economic development, while many national foundations are formulating broader strategic frameworks related to economic inclusion. Foundations are helping achieve concrete economic development results; future research requires improvements in data and in-depth case studies of places with significant philanthropic engagement.},

In terms of roles Swiss foundations are close to the U.S. foundations in their emphasis on complementarity, but in terms of approach are close to Germany with a significant number of grant-making foundations. Overall, it is found that despite some socioeconomic transformations in Switzerland the categorization of the foundation sector close to a liberal model has not fundamentally changed.},

	abstract = {While scholars of contemporary philanthropy have observed a concerted interest in the promotion of ‘self-help,’ little has been said about the political history of this investment and its signiﬁcance in determining both domestic and international development priorities. We locate this modern conceptualisation of self-help in early twentieth-century philanthropic practice that sought to ‘gift’ to individuals and communities the precious habit of self-reliance and social autonomy. The Rockefeller Foundation promoted rural development projects that deliberately sought to ‘emancipate’ the traditionbound peasant, transforming him or her into a productive, enterprising subject. We begin by documenting their early agricultural extension work, which attempted to spark agrarian change in the US South through the inculcation of modern habits and aspirations among farmers and their families. These agrarian schemes illustrate the newfound faith that ‘rural up-lift’ could only be sustained if farming communities were trained to ‘help themselves’ by investing physically and psychologically in the process of modernisation. We then locate subsequent attempts to incentivise and accelerate international agricultural development within the broader geopolitical imperatives of the Green Revolution and the Cold War. While US technical assistance undoubtedly sought to prevent political upheaval in the Third World, we argue that Rockefeller-led modernisation projects, based on insights gleaned from behavioural economics, championed a model of human capital e and the idea of ‘revolution within’ e in order to contain the threat of ‘revolution without’. Approaching agricultural development through this problematisation of the farmer reveals the ‘long history’ of the Green Revolution e unfolding from the domestic to the international and from the late nineteenth century to the present e as well as the continuing role of philanthropy in forging a new global order.},

Although the issue resurfaces in epistemological discussions concerning the positioning of the researcher, little specific attention has been given to the manner in which the great foundations controlled and guided social science research. This is true of the role of the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) in Africanist research. This paper argues that without the influence of the RF, Africanist research would have developed more slowly. Moreover, the International African Institute would most likely have ceased operation and many of the classics of the field would not have been written. This paper presents a case study of the role of the RF in the development of the IAI and its impact on the development of British social anthropology.},

Rice research in each of the different periods was driven by different framings of problems and potential solutions, incorporating wider ideologies, epistemologies, and key actors and networks, with the RF at the center. Viewed in this way, the Rockefeller Foundation’s involvement in rice research cannot be seen ‘simply’ as an agricultural modernization project, but rather as simultaneously a sociopolitical project that extends particular modes of governance through homogenization and paternalism.},

            Au cours de l’entre-deux-guerres, la fondation Rockefeller apporte une impulsion décisive à la construction du champ des sciences sociales en France, à la fois par son soutien financier important, mais aussi par sa participation, conjointement avec les universitaires français, à la conception d’un programme de recherche collectif et à la création d’un ensemble d’institutions coordonnées entre elles et unifiées par le paradigme de la recherche expérimentale qui irrigue l’ensemble des travaux qui y sont menés. L’analyse des dynamiques respectives des acteurs engagés dans ce processus montre que l’on n’a pas tant affaire au processus de diffusion/réception d’un projet américain préalablement conçu, mais plutôt à la coproduction d’un projet franco-américain par l’ajustement progressif des objectifs des deux partenaires, qui ne cessent d’évoluer au cours des négociations.

            Abstract
            The Rockefeller Foundation played a great role in the development of social sciences in France during the interwar period, not only through its important financial support to many research institutes, but also through its intellectual collaboration with French academics in order to build collective research programs based on the paradigm of empiric-quantitative research, and to develop the coordination of the work undertaken in all institutes. This process is not analyzed in this paper as a ‘diffusion/reception’ process, but rather as a coproduction resulting from the confrontation of the French and American protagonists, whose positions and conceptions were in continual evolution and adjustment with each other throughout the long negociations which led to the funding of the research programs by the Rockefeller Foundation.},

            The Rockefeller Foundation played an important role in the transition from the League of Nations to the United Nations through its collaboration with two international organisations. The first was the Economic, Financial and Transit Department (EFTD) of the LoN. By financing its move to the United States and all of its work during the Second World War, the RF would allow it to make a major contribution to the reorganisation of the global economic order after 1945. The second organisation was the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), which the RF provided with staff, working methods, and a network of contacts around the world. The RF was thus deeply involved in the redefinition of the overall structure of the system of international organisations during WWII.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the ethics and drivers of philanthropic foundations in emerging markets. A foundation organizes assets to invest in philanthropic initiatives. Previous scholarship has largely focused on developed countries, especially the United States, and has questioned the ethics behind the activities of foundations, particularly for strategic motives that served wider corporate purposes. We argue that philanthropic foundations in emerging markets have distinctive characteristics that merit separate examination. We scrutinize the ethics behind the longitudinal activity of such foundations using 70 oral history interviews with business leaders in 18 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. We find that 55 out of 70 foundations associated with these leaders have been used as vehicles for a specific type of philanthropic ethics defined as “spiritual philanthropy”. These foundations often embodied personal or family traditions, culture, and religious values, which emphasized charitable giving and social responsibility. As in the case of many of the industrial foundations in Europe, these foundations also carried founding family names and provided a structure to maintain family control and enhance corporate reputation. We argue that, as business leaders in emerging markets are more directly exposed to dire social, educational and health deprivation than their counterparts in developed countries, they are less inclined toward grandiose world-making, and their foundations are more focused on delivering immediate benefits to communities in their home countries, motivated by implicit or explicit spirituality.},

We build on the small body of existing research on foundations in environmental governance to outline a research agenda on foundations as agents of environmental governance. The agenda identifies current understandings, debates, and research gaps related to three themes: 1) the roles foundations perform in environmental governance, 2) the outcomes of environmental philanthropy, and 3) the sources of foundation legitimacy. We call for more systematic and empirical research using diverse theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches. This research agenda will contribute to literature on agency in environmental governance by providing a more comprehensive picture of who governs the environment and how. Coming at a time when foundations are facing growing public scrutiny, it can also inform contemporary debates and offer practical insights for effective and equitable environmental philanthropy.},

However, review papers can also challenge ideological assumptions by critically assessing taken-for-granted assumptions. Critical review methods are underdeveloped in the management disciplines. The information systems (IS) discipline must do more to improve the critical examination of its scientific discourse. In this paper, we present a method with guiding principles and steps for systematically conducting critical reviews of IS literature based on Habermasian strains of critical discourse analysis.

              is primarily of interest to philosophers not for its excellent account of European thought about the state but for the self–conscious philosophy which has gone into it. It is a rare historian who pauses to get his philosophy in order before he embarks on a major enterprise, though such a policy is possibly less unusual in intellectual history than in other fields. In Skinner's case, however, this order of doing things has been pushed so far that he counts as a philosopher in his own right, rather than as merely someone who is unusually careful to think about what he is doing. The publication of this major work thus provides a convenient opportunity to make a few remarks about the relation between historical theory and practice.},

Some aspects of the received conception of a speech act do not allow illocutionary force to vary in degree and therefore it would be inappropriate to deal with mitigation/reinforcementin traditional speech-act theoretical terms. But a revised conception of the speech act as bringing about a change in the interpersonal relationship between the interlocutors might be compatible with the results of the research on mitigation/reinforcementand even contribute to a better understanding of these phenomena. In this perspective, mitigation and reinforcement appear not as stylistic phenomena superficially adjoined to the speech act, but as the adjustment and tuning of the illocutionary effect itself.},

The principles of human rights were further elaborated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 whose principles, in the view of some writers, have become part of customary international law. This Declaration was in turn elaborated on in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the concept of development. It is not hard to see why the concept of development is so essential to economics in general. Economic problems involve logistic issues, and a lot of it is undoubtedly “engineering” of one kind or another. On the other hand, the success of all this has to be judged ultimately in terms of what it does to the lives of human beings. The enhancement of living conditions must clearly be an essential,if not the essential object of the entire economic exercise and that enhancement is an integral part of the concept of development. Even though the logistic and engineering problems involved in enhancing living conditions in the poor, developing countries might well be very different from those in the rich, developed ones, there is much in common in the respective exercises on the two sides of the divide. The close link between economic development and economic growth is simultaneously a matter of importance as well as a source of considerable confusion. The importance of “growth” must depend on the nature of the variable the expansion of which is considered and seen as “growth.” The chapter discusses a number of different sources of contrast that have to be clearly distinguished from each other, while drawing a distinction between development and growth. The well-being of a person can be seen as an evaluation of the functionings achieved by that person. This approach has been implicitly used by Adam Smith and Karl Marx in particular. The concept of development is by no meansunproblematic. The different problems underlying the concept have become clearer over the years based on conceptual discussions as well as from insights emerging from empirical work.},

Activities covered 11 Southern states, and Rockefeller teams found that about 40\% of the population surveyed was infected. However, the commission met strong resistance and lacked the time and resources to achieve universal county coverage and meet project goals. We explore how these constraints triggered project changes that systematically reshaped project operations and the characteristics of the counties surveyed and treated. We show that county selectivity reduced the project’s initial potential to affect hookworm prevalence estimates, treatment, and eradication in the American South.},

	abstract = {In the digital age, the abundant unstructured data on the Internet, particularly online news articles, provide opportunities for identifying social problems and understanding social systems for sustainability. However, the previous works have not paid attention to the social-problem-specific perspectives of such big data, and it is currently unclear how information technologies can use the big data to identify and manage the ongoing social problems. In this context, this paper introduces and focuses on social-problem-specific key noun terms, namely SocialTERMs, which can be used not only to search the Internet for social-problem-related data, but also to monitor the ongoing and future events of social problems. Moreover, to alleviate time-consuming human efforts in identifying the SocialTERMs, this paper designs and examines the SocialTERM-Extractor, which is an automatic approach for identifying the key noun terms of social-problem-related topics, namely SPRTs, in a large number of online news articles and predicting the SocialTERMs among the identified key noun terms. This paper has its novelty as the first trial to identify and predict the SocialTERMs from a large number of online news articles, and it contributes to literature by proposing three types of text-mining-based features, namely temporal weight, sentiment, and complex network structural features, and by comparing the performances of such features with various machine learning techniques including deep learning. Particularly, when applied to a large number of online news articles that had been published in South Korea over a 12-month period and mostly written in Korean, the experimental results showed that Boosting Decision Tree gave the best performances with the full feature sets. They showed that the SocialTERMs can be predicted with high performances by the proposed SocialTERM-Extractor. Eventually, this paper can be beneficial for individuals or organizations who want to explore and use social-problem-related data in a systematical manner for understanding and managing social problems even though they are unfamiliar with ongoing social problems.},

Bacon's works are the data in an estimation of a structural topic model, a recently developed methodology for analysis of text corpora. The estimates uncover sixteen topics prominent in Bacon's opus. Two are key elements of the ideas usually associated with Bacon—inductive epistemology and fact-seeking. The utilitarian promise of science and the centralized organization of the scientific quest, embraced by Bacon's followers, were not emphasized by him. Using strategic communication, Bacon facilitated reception of his scientific methodology, targeted influential groups, and finessed powerful opponents. We provide the first quantitative evidence that the genesis of Bacon's epistemology lies in his experience in the common-law. Combining our findings with accepted arguments in the existing literature, we suggest that the effects of common-law culture can help explain the coincidence of early political and economic development in England.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

Moreover, the dimensions issued from the different exploratory data analyses can be automatically described by quantitative and/or categorical variables. Numerous graphics are also available with various options. Finally, a graphical user interface is implemented within the \&lt;b\&gt;Rcmdr\&lt;/b\&gt; environment in order to propose an user friendly package.},

	abstract = {Similarities and differences between speech and writing have been the subject of innumerable studies, but until now there has been no attempt to provide a unified linguistic analysis of the whole range of spoken and written registers in English. In this widely acclaimed empirical study, Douglas Biber uses computational techniques to analyse the linguistic characteristics of twenty three spoken and written genres, enabling identification of the basic, underlying dimensions of variation in English. In Variation Across Speech and Writing, six dimensions of variation are identified through a factor analysis, on the basis of linguistic co-occurence patterns. The resulting model of variation provides for the description of the distinctive linguistic characteristics of any spoken or written text andd emonstrates the ways in which the polarization of speech and writing has been misleading, and thus enables reconciliation of the contradictory conclusions reached in previous research.},

	abstract = {The search engines are indispensable tools to find information amidst massive web pages and documents. A good search engine needs to retrieve information not only in a shorter time, but also relevant to the users’ queries. Most search engines provide short time retrieval to user queries; however, they provide a little guarantee of precision even to the highly detailed users’ queries. In such cases, documents clustering centered on the subject and contents might improve search results. This paper presents a novel method of document clustering, which uses semantic clique. First, we extracted the Features from the documents. Later, the associations between frequently co-occurring terms were defined, which were called as semantic cliques. Each connected component in the semantic clique represented a theme. The documents clustered based on the theme, for which we designed an aggregation algorithm. We evaluated the aggregation algorithm effectiveness using four kinds of datasets. The result showed that the semantic clique based document clustering algorithm performed significantly better than traditional clustering algorithms such as Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP), k-means, Auto-Class, and Hierarchical Clustering (HAC). We found that the Semantic Clique Aggregation is a potential model to represent association rules in text and could be immensely useful for automatic document clustering.},

	abstract = {Cluster analysis is used in many disciplines to group objects according to a defined measure of distance. Numerous algorithms exist, some based on the analysis of the local density of data points, and others on predefined probability distributions. Rodriguez and Laio devised a method in which the cluster centers are recognized as local density maxima that are far away from any points of higher density. The algorithm depends only on the relative densities rather than their absolute values. The authors tested the method on a series of data sets, and its performance compared favorably to that of established techniques. Science, this issue p. 1492 Local density of points is ranked and analyzed to categorize data. Cluster analysis is aimed at classifying elements into categories on the basis of their similarity. Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition. We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded from the analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space in which they are embedded. We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.},

	abstract = {Poststructuralist discourse theory is a tool for analyzing the more or less sedimented rules and meanings that condition the political construction of social, political, and cultural identity. It begins with the assertion that what exists only becomes intelligible when it is joined with a specific form which constitutes its identity. The formation of identity is not grounded in some metaphysical instance like God, Nature, Man, Reason, or the Iron Laws of Capitalism. Instead, discourse theory subscribes to an antiessentialist ontology, which is opposed to the idea of a self-determining center that structures society and defines identity while itself escaping the process of structuration. Hence it asserts that identity is constructed in and through a multiplicity of overlapping language games. Following Ludwig Wittgenstein (1959), language is conceived neither as a medium for the representation of an extralinguistic reality nor as a medium for the expression of our inner thoughts and emotions. Rather, it constitutes a rulebound system of meaning and action that conditions the ultimately political construction of identity.The emphasis on the constitutive role of language clearly indicates that discourse theory is a part of the linguistic turn in the social sciences. However, the point of discourse theory is neither to study how we actually speak and write nor to investigate the rules that we draw upon when speaking or writing. Discourse theory aims at a much broader analysis of the construction of discursive forms.},

Therefore, the approach proposed here is also indebted to the perspective of analysis to which Skinner faces radically.},
